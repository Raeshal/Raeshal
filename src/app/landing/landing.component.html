      Hey there! I'm a front-end enthusiast with 4+ years of experience turning ideas into beautiful, functional web apps. I specialize in Angular, but Iâ€™ve also spent good time working with React â€” so yeah, I'm pretty flexible when it comes to frameworks ðŸ˜‰
      <br>I absolutely love building clean, responsive, and scalable interfaces that not only look good but also feel good to use. Whether itâ€™s crafting dashboards, solving complex UI challenges, or making tiny pixel-perfect tweaks â€” I'm all in!     
      <br>Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked on everything from corporate portals to smart dashboards, gaining hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Angular, React, and a bunch of cool libraries (yep, even Highcharts for data stuff ðŸŽ¯). 
      I'm a big fan of clean code, performance optimization, and creating user experiences that actually make people go "wow".   
      <br>When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably scrolling through design inspo, testing out UI animations for fun, or just silently judging websites with bad UX ðŸ˜…
